# cm-image-editor
Image editor for Come Meditate YouTube Channel. Python / Qt

Mostly to automate the monolith thing (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Y7NURkLjA)

Goal - 2 modes of the editor:
- with GUI, loading/exporting images, some parameters and monolith option
- faster version run as script, editing every img from /input and saving in /output
